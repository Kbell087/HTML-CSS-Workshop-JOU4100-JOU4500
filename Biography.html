              <h1>My Life in Shediac</h1>
            <p>Nineteen years in Shediac showed me the best of times that the town could offer to anyone. Some may even say that I got a better sense of the ins and outs of Shediac than most. As I grew up with seperated parents, their houses were situated on oppisite ends of Shediac's limits. One located near the warf and the beach, the other near the fork in the bay and the big lobster statue. Being surrounded the best spots in town gave me experiences that I would never replace for mountain tops or big city lights. </p>
            <p>Although Shediac was a dream in the summer, it became a bit of a ghost town during the winter and colder seasons. Besides attending the only primary school and highschool in town during those times, the rink became my second home. Ringette was the one thing I looked forward to when the bay froze over. It was a place for the faithful local to gather and still be able to celebrate Shediac when all of the tourists were gone. When I think about it, I gues we made good use of the bay all throughout the seasons.</p>

            <p>Even if I live more than 1,200 miles away from Shediac now, my tiny apartment's walls are filled with memories made there. In fact some of my favourite memories include:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Supporting the local highschool hockey team in our home rink every Thursday night</li>
