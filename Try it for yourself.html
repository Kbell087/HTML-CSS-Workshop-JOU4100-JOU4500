              <h1>The Top 5 Best Things to do in Shediac</h1>
            <p>There is no doubt that between June and August is the greatest time to take advantage of the town's experiences. No matter what the occasion, mood or taste, Shediac has it all during the summer. Here are my top five things I think every vacation in Shedaic should include: </p>
              <ul> <li>5-Book a campsite:Choose from one of eight campgrounds that Shediac offers as one of the most authentic and exciting ways to stay.With options by the drive-in, by the beach and on the water-front, the possibilities of fun are endless. Besides, what better way to finish off a busy day in the water than by having a campfire under the country stars.</li>

                  <li>4-Head to the Paddle Shack:The blue shack on the water-front is not your typical toursit stop. The Paddle Shack offers single, double, and group paddle board rentals for a unique Shediac Bay experience. Paddling lesons, yoga, free paddle or take your dog for a paddle are just a few of the features available for those who wish to strap on a lifejacket and take-on the water.

                      <li>3-Relax on the Shediac Bay Cruise boat: A classic Shediac experiences is one that offers a guided tour on the water combined with a freshly fished dinner into the sunset. Shediac Bay Cruises have been a part of summers on the water for many years and never fail to amaze visitors. This is the perfect ay to safely enjoy the water after the sun goes down.</li>

                  <li>2-Hit the beach: Parlee Beach has attained a provincial park status with its long sand dunes and enless ocean views. Whether it's relaxing on the sand, swimming in the clear the warm water, hitting the beach volley-ball courts, or checking out the Lighthouse Restaurant, the beach is the place to be.</li>

                  <li>1-Drive down to the warf: Not only does the Pointe-du-Chene warf hve major historical significance to the town, it holds some of the best seafood restaurants as well. Captain Dan's offers a seafood bar and grill experience that comes alive at night with live music and full bars on two levels. The Sandbar takes it down a notch with a more calming and elegant approach to gourmet takes on classic seafood. The nautical views of sailboat races and children jumping off the warf allows for the most genuine feeling of being in Shediac.</li>
